# Redirect GoogleJP to Jisho

This extension redirects Google.co.jp searches to Jisho.org searches to help learning Japanese with ebooks.

Some Japanese ebook readers don't let you copy text directly, but have built in web search functionality. Assuming
your ebook reader searches your selected text on google.co.jp this will redirect you to a
[Jisho.org](https://jisho.org) search instead, so you can look up Japanese words you don't know in a single step.
